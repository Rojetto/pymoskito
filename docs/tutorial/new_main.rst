The __main__ File
---------------------

Every program needs a main. Therefore, the first file you create should be called::

	__main__.py

For a Quickstart, you can copy the following code, taken from the :doc:`'Ball and Beam' example <../examples/ballbeam>` . 

.. literalinclude:: ../../pymoskito/examples/ballbeam/__main__.py
	:language: python
	:lines: 1-28,34-41
	:linenos:
