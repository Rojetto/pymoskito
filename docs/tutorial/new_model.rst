Implementing a Model
--------------------

At first, a new class derived from the abstract class 
:py:class:`~pymoskito.simulation_modules.Model` is necessary.
Its basic functions will be calculating the state derivatives and the output,
dependant on the model parameters, the current state and the input values.

Create a folder with a path of your choice.
All files created during this tutorial need to be stored here.
Create a file called::

    model.py

With the first lines of code, import the library NumPy_, 
the OrderedDictionary class and PyMoskito itself:

.. _NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/

.. literalinclude:: minimalSystem/model.py
    :end-before: #class
    :lineno-match:

Name your class and make :py:class:`~pymoskito.simulation_modules.Model` its base class.
Create an :py:class:`OrderedDict` called :py:data:`public_settings`. 
All entries in this dictionary will be accessable in the graphical interface of PyMoskito during runtime.
While you have the freedom to name these entries as you like,
the entry ``initial state`` is obligatory and must contain the initial state vector.
All values entered will be the initial values for the model parameters
:

.. literalinclude:: minimalSystem/model.py
    :start-after: #class
    :end-before: #init
    :lineno-match:

Within the constructor, you must define the number of inputs and states.
Do so by storing these values in settings as seen in lines :py:data:`24` and :py:data:`25`. 
Adding output information as seen in line :py:data:`26` is optional,
this will change the appearance of the output diagram.
It is obligatory to call the constructor of the base class at the end
:

.. literalinclude:: minimalSystem/model.py
    :start-after: #init
    :end-before: #state
    :lineno-match:

The calculation of the state derivatives takes place in a method,
that returns the results as an array.
The method's parameters are the current time :py:data:`t`, the current state vector :py:data:`x`,
and the parameter :py:data:`args`. The later is free to be defined as you need it,
in this case it will be the force :py:data:`F` as the model input.
To prevent the model equations from resulting in huge lines of code, 
it is recommended to store the model values in variables with short names:

.. literalinclude:: minimalSystem/model.py
    :start-after: #state
    :end-before: #output
    :lineno-match:

The output of the system is calculated in a method with the current state vector as parameter.
Returning the results as an array as previously would be possible.
But in this case, the output is simply the position :py:data:`s` of the cart,
so extracting it from the state vector and returning it as a scalar is sufficient
:

.. literalinclude:: minimalSystem/model.py
    :start-after: #output
    :end-before: #register
    :lineno-match:

Do not forget to link your model to the toolbox at the 
very bottom of your code:

.. literalinclude:: minimalSystem/model.py
    :start-after: #register
    :lineno-match:
