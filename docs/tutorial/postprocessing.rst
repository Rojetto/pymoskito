Comparing Simulation Results
============================

After succesfully simulating your model, you might want to 
vary some of your variables to evaluate robustness or look for 
optimal values. 

PyMoskito provides tools to support this progress. 

Since this is not considered a basic function of the toolbox anymore,
we kindly ask you to take a look into the `full users guide`_.
