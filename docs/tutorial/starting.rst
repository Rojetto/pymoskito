========================
Starting the Program
========================

PyMoskito can not be started itself, instead you need to start an example. 
The files created in the :doc:`previous chapter <new_example>` 
are the mimimum of what the toolbox needs.
Use the command line to navigate to the directory, where the folder 'simplePendulum' is located.

You can now start the example by entering::

    $ python -m simplePendulum


or from inside the directory by calling::

    $ python .

or::

    $ python __main__.py

All of these commands will do the same thing and start the example "simple Pendulum".
