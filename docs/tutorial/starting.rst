========================
Starting the Program
========================

For PyMoskito to start, an application needs to launch the toolbox and execute it.

To do so, create a file in the same directory as the model and name it::

    __main__.py

Copy the following code into your main file: 

.. literalinclude:: minimalSystem/__main__.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 1-6,8-21
    :linenos:

Use the command line to navigate to the directory of the main file and the model file
and start the toolbox with the command::

    $ python __main__.py
