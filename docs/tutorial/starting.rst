========================
Starting the Program
========================

PyMoskito can not be started itself, instead you need to start an example. 
This Tutorial will work with the example "Ball and Beam".
Use the command line to navigate to the directory, where the folder of the example is located.

You can now start the example by entering::

    $ python -m ballbeam


or from inside the directory by calling::

    $ python .

or::

    $ python __main__.py

All of these commands will do the same thing and start the example "Ball and Beam".
