Testing the Model 
--------------------------------------------
To test your source code, but also the equations of your model,
use PyMoskito to simulate your system with no input or controller.
Choose initial states that make the prediction of the systems
reaction easy and compare them with the simulation results.

After succesfully starting the program, 
you will see the interface of the toolbox:

Within the Properties Window (1), double clicking on a value (all None by default)
activates a drop down menu.
Clicking again presents all eligible options.
One of these options as an eligible model is the class RodPendulumModel,
since it was registered and linked to PyMoskito earlier.
Choose it now and press enter to confirm your choice.

By clicking on the arrow that appeared on the left of 'Model',
all model paramters and the initial state are displayed. 
These are taken from the public part of ordered dictionary defined earlier in the model.
Double click on a value to change it manually.
Press enter to confirm the input.

Choose the RodPendulumModel, the ODEInt as Solver and the AdditiveMixer as ModelMixer. 
Change the initial state of the model to [0,100.0, 0,0]
and the end time of the solver to 20

Click the gearwheel button (2), use the drop-down menu (3) or press F5 to start the simulation.  

After a succesful simulation, all created diagrams will be listed in the Data Window (4).
Double click on one to display it:

Feel free to experiment with the properties and see, 
if the model reacts the way you would have predicted.
